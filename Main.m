%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analzye Eigenfaces and what they try to capture  %%%%%%%%%%%%
% Here we use pca function. Below are explantions which excerpt from
% matworks webiste.

% coeff:    Principal component coefficients, returned as a p-by-p matrix. 
%           Each column of coeff contains coefficients for one principal component. 
%           The columns are in the order of descending component variance, latent.
% score:    Principal component scores, returned as a matrix. 
%           Rows of score correspond to observations, and columns to components.
% latent:   Principal component variances, that is the eigenvalues of 
%           the covariance matrix of X, returned as a column vector.
% tsquared: Hotellingâ€™s T-Squared Statistic, which is the sum of squares 
%           of the standardized scores for each observation, returned as a column vector.
% explained: Percentage of the total variance explained 
%           by each principal component, returned as a column vector.
%           Estimated means of the variables in X, 
%           returned as a row vector when Centered is set to true. 
%           When Centered is false, the software does not compute the means 
%           and returns a vector of zeros.

% Set number of components to retain
nComponents = 10;


% ===== How to set parameter for pca() =====

% Default. pca centers X by subtracting column means 
% before computing singular value decomposition or eigenvalue decomposition. 
% If X contains NaN missing values, 
% nanmean is used to find the mean with any available data. 
% You can reconstruct the centered data using score*coeff'.

% VariableWeights
% If 'Centered' is set to true at the same time, 
% the data matrix X is centered and standardized. 
% In this case, pca returns the principal components 
% based on the correlation matrix.
